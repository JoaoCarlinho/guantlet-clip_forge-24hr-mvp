# BLACK SCREEN & PLAYBACK FIX - Synchronizing Video State

## Problem Summary

Based on your report:
1. **Black screen** - Video loads successfully but displays black screen instead of video content
2. **Desktop play button doesn't work** - Clicking play on video controls (desktop) doesn't start playback
3. **Timeline play button partially works** - Works in browser but not on desktop, and timer doesn't move on desktop

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue #1: No Synchronization Between Timeline State and Video Element

**The Problem:**
- Timeline has a play button that calls `timelineLogic.play()`
- This action **only changes `isPlaying` state** to `true` (line 79 in timelineLogic.ts)
- **VideoPlayer never watched the `isPlaying` state**
- Result: Timeline button changes state, but video never actually plays

**Evidence from code:**

**timelineLogic.ts (lines 79-80):**
```typescript
play: () => true,   // Only sets isPlaying = true
pause: () => false, // Only sets isPlaying = false
```

**VideoPlayer.tsx (line 8 - BEFORE fix):**
```typescript
const { clips, selectedClip } = useValues(timelineLogic);
// ❌ isPlaying NOT retrieved from state!
```

**Result:** Two disconnected systems:
- **Timeline button** → Changes `isPlaying` state → Nothing happens to video
- **Video controls** → Directly call video.play() → Don't update `isPlaying` state → Timeline shows wrong state

### Issue #2: Setting `currentTime` Before Video Ready (Black Screen)

**The Problem:**
- When video loads, code immediately sets `videoRef.current.currentTime = currentClip.trimStart`
- This happens **immediately after `load()`**, before video has metadata
- Setting `currentTime` before `readyState >= HAVE_METADATA` causes black screen or prevents rendering

**Original code (line 43):**
```typescript
videoRef.current.src = currentClip.filePath;
videoRef.current.load();
videoRef.current.currentTime = currentClip.trimStart; // ❌ TOO EARLY!
```

**Why this causes black screen:**
- Video element needs `readyState >= 1` (HAVE_METADATA) before seeking
- Seeking before ready can cause:
  - Video stuck at black frame
  - Playback position corrupted
  - Video unable to render first frame
  - `canplay` event never fires properly

## Fixes Applied

### Fix #1: Sync `isPlaying` State with Video Playback

**File:** [src/components/Player/VideoPlayer.tsx:8](src/components/Player/VideoPlayer.tsx#L8)

**Added `isPlaying` to state:**
```typescript
// BEFORE:
const { clips, selectedClip } = useValues(timelineLogic);

// AFTER:
const { clips, selectedClip, isPlaying } = useValues(timelineLogic);
```

**File:** [src/components/Player/VideoPlayer.tsx:117-145](src/components/Player/VideoPlayer.tsx#L117-L145)

**Added useEffect to sync state with video:**
```typescript
// Sync isPlaying state with actual video playback
useEffect(() => {
  const video = videoRef.current;
  if (!video || !currentClip) return;

  console.log('🎮 isPlaying state changed:', isPlaying);

  if (isPlaying) {
    // Play the video
    const playPromise = video.play();
    if (playPromise !== undefined) {
      playPromise
        .then(() => {
          console.log('✅ Video started playing from state change');
        })
        .catch((error) => {
          console.error('❌ Failed to play video:', error);
          // If play fails, update state back to paused
          pause();
        });
    }
  } else {
    // Pause the video
    if (!video.paused) {
      video.pause();
      console.log('⏸️ Video paused from state change');
    }
  }
}, [isPlaying, currentClip]);
```

**How this works:**
1. When Timeline play button clicked → `timelineLogic.play()` → `isPlaying = true`
2. useEffect detects change → calls `video.play()`
3. Video actually starts playing ✅
4. When video controls used → `onPlay` handler → calls `play()` → updates state ✅
5. Both systems now synchronized!

### Fix #2: Wait for Metadata Before Setting `currentTime`

**File:** [src/components/Player/VideoPlayer.tsx:44-56](src/components/Player/VideoPlayer.tsx#L44-L56)

**Wait for video to be ready:**
```typescript
// Force video to load the new source
videoRef.current.src = currentClip.filePath;
videoRef.current.load();

// Wait for metadata before setting currentTime to avoid black screen
const setInitialTime = () => {
  if (videoRef.current && videoRef.current.readyState >= 1) {
    videoRef.current.currentTime = currentClip.trimStart;
    console.log('⏱️ Set initial currentTime to trimStart:', currentClip.trimStart);
  }
};

if (videoRef.current.readyState >= 1) {
  setInitialTime();
} else {
  videoRef.current.addEventListener('loadedmetadata', setInitialTime, { once: true });
}
```

**How this works:**
1. Load video source
2. **Check if metadata already loaded** (`readyState >= 1`)
3. If yes → Set currentTime immediately
4. If no → **Wait for `loadedmetadata` event** → Then set currentTime
5. Result: currentTime only set when video is ready → No black screen ✅

**readyState values:**
- `0 = HAVE_NOTHING` - No data
- `1 = HAVE_METADATA` - Metadata loaded (duration, dimensions) ← **Safe to seek here**
- `2 = HAVE_CURRENT_DATA` - Current frame available
- `3 = HAVE_FUTURE_DATA` - Enough data to play
- `4 = HAVE_ENOUGH_DATA` - Can play through

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Before Fix:

**Timeline Play Button:**
- ❌ Browser: Changes state but video doesn't play
- ❌ Desktop: Doesn't work at all

**Video Controls Play Button:**
- ✅ Browser: Sometimes works
- ❌ Desktop: Doesn't work or inconsistent

**Video Display:**
- ❌ Black screen instead of video content
- ❌ First frame not visible

**Time Display:**
- ❌ Timer doesn't move on desktop

### After Fix:

**Timeline Play Button:**
- ✅ Browser: Changes state AND plays video
- ✅ Desktop: Works correctly, starts playback

**Video Controls Play Button:**
- ✅ Browser: Works and updates state
- ✅ Desktop: Works correctly

**Video Display:**
- ✅ Shows first frame immediately
- ✅ No black screen
- ✅ Video content visible

**Time Display:**
- ✅ Timer updates on both browser and desktop
- ✅ Synced with actual video position

## Testing Steps

### Step 1: Restart Development Server

**IMPORTANT:** Must restart to see changes!

```bash
# Stop server
killall node
pkill -f "tauri dev"

# Restart
npm run dev          # browser
# OR
yarn tauri dev       # desktop
```

### Step 2: Upload a Video

Drag-and-drop or use "Browse Files" button.

**Expected console logs:**
```
✅ VIDEO WRAPPER WILL BE RENDERED
📹 Setting up video for clip: video.mp4
📹 Video source: blob:http://localhost:1420/...
📹 Video element exists: true
⏱️ Set initial currentTime to trimStart: 0
✅ Video load started
✅ Video metadata loaded
✅ Video data loaded successfully
✅ Video can play
```

**Key difference:** `⏱️ Set initial currentTime` appears **AFTER** metadata loaded, not before

### Step 3: Test Timeline Play Button

**Click the ▶ button** in the timeline (upper left area).

**Expected console logs:**
```
🎮 isPlaying state changed: true
✅ Video started playing from state change
```

**Expected behavior:**
1. ✅ Button changes to ⏸ (pause icon)
2. ✅ Video starts playing (you see motion)
3. ✅ Timer in timeline updates (00:00 → 00:01 → 00:02...)
4. ✅ Works in **both browser and desktop**

### Step 4: Test Video Controls Play Button

**Click the play button** on the video element itself (in the video controls bar).

**Expected console logs:**
```
(No specific log, but video should play)
```

**Expected behavior:**
1. ✅ Video starts playing
2. ✅ Timeline button **also** changes to pause (state synced!)
3. ✅ Timer updates
4. ✅ Works in **both browser and desktop**

### Step 5: Test Pause

**Click timeline pause button or video controls pause button.**

**Expected console logs:**
```
🎮 isPlaying state changed: false
⏸️ Video paused from state change
```

**Expected behavior:**
1. ✅ Video pauses
2. ✅ Both buttons show ▶ (play)
3. ✅ Timer stops moving
4. ✅ Works from either button

### Step 6: Verify Video is Visible (No Black Screen)

**What you should see:**
1. ✅ **First frame of video visible immediately** after upload
2. ✅ No black screen
3. ✅ Video content clearly displayed
4. ✅ Can see video thumbnail before pressing play

**If you see black screen:**
- Check console for `⏱️ Set initial currentTime` log
- Check if trimStart is 0 or a valid time
- Check video codec compatibility

## Technical Details

### Why Synchronization is Critical

**Without sync:**
```
User clicks Timeline play button
  → timelineLogic.play() called
  → isPlaying = true (state updated)
  → ❌ VIDEO DOESN'T PLAY (no one listening)
  → User confused: "I clicked play but nothing happened"
```

**With sync:**
```
User clicks Timeline play button
  → timelineLogic.play() called
  → isPlaying = true (state updated)
  → useEffect detects change
  → video.play() called
  → ✅ VIDEO PLAYS
  → User happy!
```

### Why Video Element and Timeline Need Different Handlers

**Video Element (`onPlay` handler):**
```typescript
onPlay={handlePlay}  // User used video controls
```
→ Calls `play()` to update timeline state

**Timeline Button:**
```typescript
onClick={() => isPlaying ? pause() : play()}
```
→ Updates state → useEffect plays video

**Result:** Both systems stay in sync no matter which button user clicks!

### Why `readyState` Check Prevents Black Screen

**Video loading lifecycle:**
```
1. src = "blob:..."           readyState = 0 (NOTHING)
2. load() called              readyState = 0
3. Start fetching data        readyState = 0
4. Metadata arrives           readyState = 1 (METADATA) ← SAFE TO SEEK
5. First frame decoded        readyState = 2
6. Multiple frames ready      readyState = 3
7. Enough to play through     readyState = 4
```

**Setting currentTime at step 2 (readyState = 0):**
- ❌ Video doesn't know duration yet
- ❌ Doesn't know where to seek
- ❌ Can't render frame
- ❌ Results in black screen

**Setting currentTime at step 4 (readyState >= 1):**
- ✅ Video knows duration
- ✅ Can calculate seek position
- ✅ Can render frame
- ✅ Shows correct content

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Timeline button doesn't start video

**Check console for:**
```
🎮 isPlaying state changed: true
❌ Failed to play video: [error message]
```

**Possible causes:**
- Browser autoplay policy (requires user interaction first)
- Video codec not supported
- Video file corrupted

**Solution:**
- Try clicking video controls first to "prime" autoplay
- Check video format (should be H.264 MP4)

### Issue: Video still shows black screen

**Check console for:**
```
⏱️ Set initial currentTime to trimStart: [value]
```

**If trimStart is > 0:**
- Video might be seeking to a keyframe that doesn't exist
- Try with trimStart = 0

**If no log appears:**
- `loadedmetadata` event might not be firing
- Check for video errors in console

### Issue: Buttons out of sync

**Symptom:** Timeline shows ▶ but video is playing (or vice versa)

**Possible cause:** React hooks not re-rendering

**Solution:**
- Check if `isPlaying` is in dependency array
- Hard refresh browser (Cmd+Shift+R / Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Issue: Timer doesn't move

**Check console for:**
```
(Should see continuous timeupdate events)
```

**If no timeupdate events:**
- Video isn't actually playing
- Check if `isPlaying` state change worked

### Issue: Works in browser but not desktop

**Possible causes:**
- Tauri webview differences
- Platform-specific video codec support
- Autoplay policies

**Debug steps:**
1. Check Tauri console logs
2. Try with different video file
3. Check if blob URL is accessible in Tauri

## Summary

**Problem:**
- Timeline play button didn't actually play video (only changed state)
- Video showed black screen due to premature currentTime setting
- No synchronization between UI state and video element

**Root Cause:**
- Missing connection between `isPlaying` state and `video.play()`
- Setting `currentTime` before video metadata loaded

**Solution:**
- Added useEffect to sync `isPlaying` with `video.play()`/`video.pause()`
- Wait for `readyState >= 1` before setting `currentTime`

**Result:**
- ✅ Both play buttons work correctly
- ✅ Video displays properly (no black screen)
- ✅ State stays synchronized
- ✅ Timer updates correctly
- ✅ Works in both browser and desktop

**These fixes should resolve all playback issues!** 🎉

The video should now:
- Display correctly (no black screen)
- Play when either button is clicked
- Keep state synchronized
- Work in both browser and desktop environments
