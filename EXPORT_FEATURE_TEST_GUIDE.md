### Test 6: Quality Comparison
**Purpose**: Verify quality settings produce different results

**Prerequisites**:
- Same 2-clip sequence for all tests

**Steps**:
1. Create 2-clip timeline (total ~20 seconds)
2. Export with Low quality → save as `export_low.mp4`
3. Clear export, reload clips
4. Export with Medium quality → save as `export_medium.mp4`
5. Clear export, reload clips
6. Export with High quality → save as `export_high.mp4`
7. Compare files:
   - File sizes
   - Visual quality (play side-by-side)
   - Encoding time

**Expected Results**:
| Quality | File Size | Visual Quality | Encoding Time |
|---------|-----------|----------------|---------------|
| Low     | Smallest  | Acceptable     | Fastest       |
| Medium  | Medium    | Good           | Moderate      |
| High    | Largest   | Excellent      | Slowest       |

**Quality Indicators**:
- Low: Some compression artifacts visible in detailed areas

   - Clip A: trimmed to 10s
   - Clip B: trimmed to 15s
   - Clip C: trimmed to 5s
2. Click "Export 3 Clips"
3. Inspect preview modal

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Shows "Clips: 3"
- ✅ Shows "Total Duration: 0:30"
- ✅ Clip list shows 3 items in correct order
- ✅ Each clip shows correct name
- ✅ Each clip shows correct individual duration
- ✅ "Cancel" button closes modal without exporting
- ✅ "Start Export" button closes modal and begins export

### Test 8: Edge Cases

#### 8.1: Export with No Trim Markers
**Steps**:
1. Add clip without setting trim markers (full duration)
2. Export

**Expected**: Should export full clip duration

#### 8.2: Export Very Short Clips
**Steps**:
1. Add clip trimmed to < 1 second (e.g., 0.5s)
2. Export

**Expected**: Should handle sub-second durations correctly

#### 8.3: Export Maximum Trim Range
**Steps**:
1. Add clip with IN=0, OUT=full duration
2. Export

**Expected**: Should work identically to no trim markers

#### 8.4: Mixed Video Formats (Future Test)
**Steps**:
1. Add clips with different resolutions/codecs
2. Export

**Note**: Currently expects all MP4s; mixed format support is future enhancement

---

## Known Issues and Limitations

### Current Limitations:
1. **Bundle Size**: 530 KB main bundle may cause slow initial load
2. **Memory**: Browser memory limit (~2 GB) restricts very large exports
3. **Format Support**: Input must be MP4; output is always MP4
4. **Resolution**: All clips should have same resolution for best results
5. **Tauri Build**: Requires Cargo/Rust toolchain (not tested in this phase)

### Future Enhancements (Not in Scope):
- Dynamic FFmpeg loading (reduce initial bundle)
- Batch processing for 20+ clips
- Memory usage warnings before export
- Resume failed exports
- Progress estimation (time remaining)
- Mixed resolution handling (automatic scaling)

- ✅ No critical bugs found

---

## Additional Notes

### Performance Tips:
- Use "Low" quality for testing iterations
- Close other browser tabs during large exports
- Clear browser cache if repeated exports fail
- Restart browser if memory usage seems high

### Debug Mode:
- Open browser console to see detailed FFmpeg logs
- Progress logs show each export phase
- Error logs include FFmpeg error codes

### FFmpeg Verification:
The application uses FFmpeg WASM v0.12.15. To verify it loads correctly:
1. Open browser console
2. Add a clip and start export
3. Look for: `✅ FFmpeg initialized successfully`
4. If you see FFmpeg errors, check browser compatibility (requires SharedArrayBuffer support)
