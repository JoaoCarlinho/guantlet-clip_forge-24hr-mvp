# MP4 Conversion Fix

## Problem
The MP4 conversion was not executing because of a component re-render issue.

## Root Cause
When `setLastRecording(clip)` was called in [RecordingControls.tsx:48](src/components/Recording/RecordingControls.tsx#L48), it triggered Kea state updates that caused the RecordingControls component to re-render repeatedly (infinite re-render loop). This prevented the MP4 conversion code (lines 51-110) from executing.

Evidence from browser console logs:
```
RecordingControls.tsx:43 üíæ Saving clip to Kea logic and timeline
RecordingControls.tsx:13 [KEA] Event: beforeBuild
RecordingControls.tsx:13 [KEA] Event: beforeMount
RecordingControls.tsx:14 [KEA] Event: beforeUnmount
... (repeated many times)
RecordingControls.tsx:49 üé¨ Auto-saving clip to timeline
```

The log at line 49 (from the setTimeout callback) appeared, but none of the FFmpeg conversion logs (lines 51-110) appeared, proving that code never executed.

## Solution
Moved the MP4 conversion and download logic BEFORE calling `setLastRecording(clip)`.

### Changed Execution Order:
**Before:**
1. Get clip from recorder
2. Call `setLastRecording(clip)` ‚Üí triggers re-renders
3. FFmpeg conversion code (never executes due to re-renders)
4. setTimeout to save to timeline

**After:**
1. Get clip from recorder
2. FFmpeg conversion and download (executes before any state changes)
3. Call `setLastRecording(clip)` ‚Üí can now safely trigger re-renders
4. setTimeout to save to timeline

## Files Modified
- [RecordingControls.tsx](src/components/Recording/RecordingControls.tsx#L41-L124) - Moved conversion logic before `setLastRecording` call

## Testing Instructions
1. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Open Chrome browser at http://localhost:1420
3. Click "Start Recording" and select a window
4. Record for a few seconds
5. Click "Stop"
6. Check browser console for FFmpeg logs
7. Verify MP4 file downloads automatically

## Expected Behavior
- Console should show:
  - "üîç Checking FFmpeg support..."
  - "‚úÖ FFmpeg is supported, starting conversion..."
  - "üé¨ Converting WebM to MP4..."
  - Progress logs
  - "‚úÖ Conversion successful!"
  - "‚¨áÔ∏è Auto-downloading MP4..."
- MP4 file should download automatically to Downloads folder
- Clip should appear in timeline

## Fallback Behavior
If SharedArrayBuffer is not available (missing COOP/COEP headers):
- Console will show FFmpeg not supported warning
- WebM file will download instead
- User can still use the recording

## Next Steps
If MP4 conversion still doesn't work:
1. Check if SharedArrayBuffer is available: `typeof SharedArrayBuffer !== 'undefined'`
2. Verify COOP/COEP headers in browser DevTools ‚Üí Network tab
3. Check for FFmpeg.js loading errors
4. Verify the conversion progress logs appear
