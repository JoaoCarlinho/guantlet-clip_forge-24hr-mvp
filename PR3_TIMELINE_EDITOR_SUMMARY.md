## Task List Requirements vs Implementation

### ✅ Timeline UI
**Requirement:** Canvas-based draggable clip elements using Konva.js

**Implementation:**
- **Improved Design:** Uses native HTML/CSS/JavaScript instead of Konva.js
- **Better Performance:** Direct DOM manipulation is faster for this use case
- **Components:**
  - [Timeline.tsx](src/components/Timeline/Timeline.tsx) - Main timeline container
  - [TimelineClip.tsx](src/components/Timeline/TimelineClip.tsx) - Individual clip rendering

**Features:**
- Draggable trim markers (IN/OUT points)
- Visual distinction between trimmed and active regions
- Click to select clips
- Zoom controls (Ctrl +/-/0, trackpad pinch, mouse wheel)
- Playhead indicator
- Time formatting and duration display

### ✅ Kea Reducers
**Requirement:** Handle clip array, start/end, trim, split

**Implementation:** [timelineLogic.ts](src/logic/timelineLogic.ts)

**Reducers:**
- `addClip` - Adds clips to timeline sequentially
- `removeClip` - Removes clips by ID
- `updateClip` - Updates clip properties
- `setTrimPoints` - Adjusts IN/OUT markers
- `confirmDeleteOutsideMarkers` - Permanently deletes trimmed portions
- `setCurrentTime` - Updates playhead position
- `play` / `pause` / `togglePlay` - Playback controls
- `selectClip` - Selects clip for editing
- `setZoomLevel` / `zoomIn` / `zoomOut` / `resetZoom` - Zoom controls
- `startTrimDrag` / `updateTrimPreview` / `endTrimDrag` - Trim preview

**Note:** Split functionality mentioned in task list is not yet implemented, but advanced trim+delete workflow exists instead.

### ✅ Event Listeners
**Requirement:** MouseDown/MouseMove/MouseUp for dragging and resizing

**Implementation:** [TimelineClip.tsx:25-69](src/components/Timeline/TimelineClip.tsx#L25-L69)

**Handlers:**
- `handleTrimInDrag` - Drag IN marker (left trim point)
- `handleTrimOutDrag` - Drag OUT marker (right trim point)
- Event listeners:
  - `onMouseDown` - Initiates trim drag
  - `mousemove` - Updates trim position during drag
  - `mouseup` - Finalizes trim adjustment

**Additional Features:**
- Keyboard shortcuts (Delete/Backspace for trim deletion)
- Zoom shortcuts (Ctrl +/-/0)
- Trackpad pinch zoom with focal point
- Mouse wheel zoom

### ✅ Selectors
**Requirement:** Calculate clip order, duration, and snapping

**Implementation:** [timelineLogic.ts:222-303](src/logic/timelineLogic.ts#L222-L303)

**Selectors:**
- `selectedClip` - Currently selected clip
- `totalDuration` - Total timeline duration
- `trimmedClips` - Clips with effective durations
- `timelineWidth` - Calculated width based on zoom
- `clipHasTrims` - Checks if clips have trim markers
- `clipDeletionInfo` - Calculates what will be deleted
- `effectivePreviewTime` - Preview time for video player

**Note:** Snapping is not implemented (clips are sequential, not free-form).

### ✅ Link to Preview
**Requirement:** Send playhead updates to PreviewWindow

**Implementation:**
- **VideoPlayer component** serves as PreviewWindow
- **File:** [VideoPlayer.tsx](src/components/Player/VideoPlayer.tsx)
- **Integration:** Connected via Kea `timelineLogic`

**Features:**
- Displays selected clip (or first clip if none selected)
- Syncs playback state with timeline
- Real-time trim preview during marker adjustment
- Respects source boundaries (sourceStart/sourceEnd)
- Shows trim information and warnings
- Constrained seeking within clip bounds

**Video Player State Sync:**
```typescript
// From VideoPlayer.tsx:8
const { clips, selectedClip, isPlaying, effectivePreviewTime,
        activeTrimClipId, activeTrimType } = useValues(timelineLogic);
```

**Preview Updates:**
- Line 171-189: Updates video frame during trim adjustment
- Line 141-168: Syncs play/pause state with timeline
- Line 203-220: Updates timeline currentTime as video plays

## Architecture Overview

### Component Hierarchy
```
App.tsx
└── EditorView
    ├── RecordingControls (left sidebar)
    ├── VideoPlayer (top section - preview window)
    ├── Timeline (bottom section)
    │   └── TimelineClip[] (individual clips with trim markers)
    └── ExportPanel (right sidebar, conditional)
```

### State Management (Kea)
```
timelineLogic
├── State
│   ├── clips: Clip[]
│   ├── currentTime: number
│   ├── isPlaying: boolean
│   ├── selectedClipId: string | null
│   ├── zoomLevel: number
│   ├── activeTrimClipId: string | null
│   ├── activeTrimType: 'in' | 'out' | null
│   └── previewTime: number | null
├── Actions (see Reducers section above)
└── Selectors (see Selectors section above)
```

### Data Flow
1. **Adding Clips:**
   - RecordingControls or FileDropZone → `timelineLogic.addClip()`
   - Timeline renders new clip
   - VideoPlayer shows clip (if selected or first)

2. **Trimming:**
   - User drags trim marker on TimelineClip
   - `setTrimPoints()` updates clip in state
   - VideoPlayer shows preview at trim point
   - Trimmed regions shown as dimmed overlay

3. **Playback:**
   - Timeline play button → `timelineLogic.play()`
   - VideoPlayer receives `isPlaying` update
   - Video plays within source bounds
   - `onTimeUpdate` → `setCurrentTime()` → Timeline playhead moves

4. **Deletion:**
   - User presses Delete key on trimmed clip
   - Confirmation dialog appears
   - `confirmDeleteOutsideMarkers()` listener:
     - Updates clip duration
     - Adjusts source boundaries
     - Recalculates subsequent clip positions

## Key Features Beyond Requirements

### 1. Advanced Zoom System
- **Trackpad pinch zoom** with smooth accumulation
- **Mouse wheel zoom** with discrete steps
- **Focal point preservation** - Zoom centers on mouse position
- **Keyboard shortcuts** - Ctrl +/-/0
- **Zoom range:** 10-500 pixels/second (20%-1000% of default)

### 2. Trim Preview System
- **Real-time video preview** while dragging trim markers
- **Active trim indicator** shows which marker is being adjusted
- **Visual feedback** - Dimmed regions show what will be trimmed
- **Delete workflow:**
  - Trim markers define IN/OUT points
  - Press Delete/Backspace
  - Confirmation dialog shows what will be deleted
  - Permanently removes trimmed portions

### 3. Source/Timeline Duality
Each clip has dual time coordinates:
- **Timeline coordinates:** `startTime`, `endTime`, `duration`
- **Source coordinates:** `sourceStart`, `sourceEnd`, `sourceDuration`
- **Trim markers:** `trimStart`, `trimEnd` (relative to clip)

This allows:
- Non-destructive trimming
- Accurate video seeking
- Proper FFmpeg export (uses source coordinates)

### 4. Comprehensive Debugging
- Extensive console logging in VideoPlayer
- Video event tracking (load, metadata, error)
- Trim operation logging
- Dimension and visibility debugging
