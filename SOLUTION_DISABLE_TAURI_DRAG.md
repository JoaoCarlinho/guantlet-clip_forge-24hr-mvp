# SOLUTION: Disable Tauri Drag-Drop to Enable HTML5

## 🎯 Problem Identified

You reported:
- ✅ **Browser:** Drag-and-drop works perfectly
- ❌ **Desktop:** Drag-and-drop doesn't work, only Browse Files button works

## Root Cause

When `dragDropEnabled: true` in Tauri config:
- Tauri **intercepts all drag-drop events** from the OS
- Tauri tries to emit its own `tauri://file-drop` events
- **But on macOS, these events don't fire reliably**
- This **blocks HTML5 events** from reaching the webview
- Result: No drag-drop works in desktop app

## The Solution

**Change `dragDropEnabled` from `true` to `false`**

### In `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`:

```json
{
  "app": {
    "windows": [{
      "dragDropEnabled": false  // ← Changed from true to false
    }]
  }
}
```

### Why This Works

When `dragDropEnabled: false`:
- ✅ Tauri **stops intercepting** drag-drop events
- ✅ HTML5 events **reach the webview** normally
- ✅ Our HTML5 handlers in FileDropZone **catch the events**
- ✅ Works exactly like in browser mode

## What This Means

### Before (dragDropEnabled: true):
```
OS Drag Event
  ↓
Tauri intercepts it
  ↓
Tauri tries to emit tauri://file-drop
  ↓
❌ Event never fires on macOS
  ↓
HTML5 events never reached webview
  ↓
❌ Nothing works
```

### After (dragDropEnabled: false):
```
OS Drag Event
  ↓
Tauri DOESN'T intercept it
  ↓
Event reaches webview
  ↓
HTML5 dragenter/drop events fire
  ↓
FileDropZone.tsx handlers catch it
  ↓
✅ Files process successfully!
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### In Desktop App:
1. Drag video file over window
2. **See console log:** `🎯 DRAG ENTER EVENT FIRED`
3. See visual feedback (drag overlay)
4. Drop file
5. **See console log:** `📦 DROP EVENT FIRED`
6. Video processes and plays

### In Browser (Should Still Work):
- Same as before, HTML5 events work unchanged

## Testing After Fix

### Step 1: Restart App
```bash
# Stop current app (Ctrl+C)
yarn tauri dev
```

### Step 2: Test Drag-Drop in Desktop
1. Drag an MP4 or MOV file over the app window
2. Should see drag overlay appear
3. Drop the file
4. **Expected console logs:**
   ```
   🎯 DRAG ENTER EVENT FIRED {dragCounter: 0, hasItems: true, ...}
   ✅ Setting isDragging to TRUE
   🔄 DRAG OVER EVENT FIRED
   📦 DROP EVENT FIRED {filesCount: 1, types: ["Files"]}
   📁 Dropped 1 file(s): ["video.mp4"]
   Processing file: video.mp4, type: video/mp4, size: XX MB
   ✓ Added clip: video.mp4 (XXX.XXs)
   ```

### Step 3: Verify Video Plays
- Video should appear in player
- Click play button
- Video should play normally

## Trade-offs

### What We Lose:
- ❌ Tauri native drag-drop events (weren't working anyway on macOS)
- ❌ Tauri's `convertFileSrc()` for dropped files (not needed for File objects)

### What We Gain:
- ✅ **Drag-drop works in desktop app** (most important!)
- ✅ **Consistent behavior** between browser and desktop
- ✅ **Simpler code** - one path instead of two
- ✅ **No macOS-specific bugs** to deal with

## Why Tauri Native Doesn't Work

From Tauri GitHub issues and discussions:
- macOS has strict security around file access
- WebView sandboxing interferes with native events
- Different macOS versions behave differently
- Even with permissions, events are unreliable
- **Recommended approach: Use HTML5 drag-drop**

## Alternative Solutions We Tried

1. ✅ **Fixed Tauri event names** (`'tauri://file-drop'`)
2. ✅ **Added permissions** (`core:event:allow-listen`)
3. ✅ **Added window handlers** (global event prevention)
4. ❌ **None of these made Tauri events fire**

The only solution that works: **Disable Tauri's interception and use HTML5**

## File Changes Summary

| File | Change | Reason |
|------|--------|--------|
| `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` | `dragDropEnabled: false` | Let HTML5 events through |
| `src/components/shared/FileDropZone.tsx` | Already has HTML5 handlers | Will now catch events |
| `src/App.tsx` | Already has window handlers | Prevents default behavior |

## Verification Checklist

After restarting the app:

- [ ] App starts without errors
- [ ] Drag file over desktop app window
- [ ] See `🎯 DRAG ENTER EVENT FIRED` in console
- [ ] See drag overlay appear
- [ ] Drop file
- [ ] See `📦 DROP EVENT FIRED` in console
- [ ] File processes successfully
- [ ] Video loads and plays
- [ ] Can drag additional files
- [ ] Browse Files button still works

## Summary

**Problem:** `dragDropEnabled: true` blocks HTML5 events on macOS
**Solution:** Set `dragDropEnabled: false` to let HTML5 events through
**Result:** Drag-and-drop works in desktop app just like in browser

**This is the recommended approach for Tauri apps that need reliable drag-drop on macOS!**

---

## Next Steps

1. **Restart the app:** `yarn tauri dev`
2. **Test drag-and-drop** in the desktop app
3. **Should work immediately!**

The fix is applied. Let me know if drag-and-drop works after restarting! 🎉
