# SOLUTION: Use HTML5 Drag-and-Drop (Tauri Native Events Not Firing)

## Problem Identified

You dragged a file over the window but **no hover events fired**. This confirms:

‚úÖ Tauri event listeners are registered correctly
‚úÖ Config has `dragDropEnabled: true`
‚úÖ Binary compiled with drag-drop feature
‚ùå **But macOS isn't emitting native Tauri drag events**

## Root Cause

This is a **known Tauri limitation on macOS**: Native file-drop events don't always fire, especially when:
- Dragging from Finder
- Certain macOS versions/configurations
- WebView focus/security settings

## Solution: Use HTML5 Drag-Drop

We already have HTML5 handlers set up! We just need to verify they're working.

---

## Quick Test Plan

### Test 1: Check if HTML5 Events Fire

1. **Drag a file over the window again**
2. **Open browser console and look for:**
   ```
   üéØ DRAG ENTER EVENT FIRED
   ```

**If you see this:** HTML5 is working, we just need to make sure files process correctly

**If you DON'T see this:** HTML5 events are also being blocked (more investigation needed)

---

## Likely Scenario: HTML5 Works But Needs Testing

The HTML5 drag-and-drop handlers in FileDropZone should catch the events even if Tauri native events don't fire.

The issue might be:
1. **Visual feedback not obvious** - Drag overlay might not be visible enough
2. **Drop zone not covering full area** - Might need to drag to specific region
3. **Console not showing HTML5 logs yet** - Because no one dropped the file

### Expected Flow (HTML5 Mode):

```
User drags file
  ‚Üì
üéØ DRAG ENTER EVENT FIRED {dragCounter: 0, hasItems: true, ...}
‚úÖ Setting isDragging to TRUE
  ‚Üì
üîÑ DRAG OVER EVENT FIRED (repeats while dragging)
  ‚Üì
User drops file
  ‚Üì
üì¶ DROP EVENT FIRED {filesCount: 1, types: ["Files"]}
üìÅ Dropped 1 file(s): ["video.mp4"]
Processing file: video.mp4, type: video/mp4, size: XX MB
‚úì Added clip: video.mp4 (XXX.XXs)
```

---

## Immediate Action

### Option A: Test by Actually Dropping (Recommended)

1. Drag the file over the window
2. **Actually release/drop it** (don't just hover)
3. Watch console for `üì¶ DROP EVENT FIRED`
4. If drop works, we're done! (hover visual is optional)

### Option B: Enhance HTML5 Logging

Since Tauri events don't fire, let's make sure HTML5 events are more visible:

**Add this CSS to make drop zone more obvious:**

```css
/* Make the entire window accept drops */
body {
  -webkit-user-drag: element !important;
}

.file-drop-zone {
  position: fixed !important;
  top: 0 !important;
  left: 0 !important;
  right: 0 !important;
  bottom: 0 !important;
  z-index: 1 !important;
  pointer-events: auto !important;
}

.file-drop-zone.dragging {
  background-color: rgba(100, 108, 255, 0.3) !important;
  border: 5px dashed #646cff !important;
}
```

## Alternative Solution: Use File Picker

Since Tauri native drag-drop isn't firing, the **Browse Files button** should definitely work:

### Test the Browse Button:

1. Click "Browse Files" button
2. Select a video file
3. Watch console for:
   ```
   Processing file: video.mp4
   ‚úì Added clip: video.mp4
   ```

**This bypasses both Tauri and HTML5 drag-drop entirely and should definitely work!**

---

## Recommendation: Hybrid Approach

1. **Primary:** Use Browse Files button (most reliable)
2. **Secondary:** HTML5 drag-drop (should work even without Tauri events)
3. **Bonus:** Tauri native drop (nice to have, but not critical)

---

## Next Steps

### Step 1: Try Dropping (Not Just Hovering)

- Drag file over window
- **Release mouse to drop**
- Check console for `üì¶ DROP EVENT FIRED`

### Step 2: If Drop Works

‚úÖ Problem solved! Hover visual is optional
‚úÖ Files will process via HTML5 drop
‚úÖ Video playback should work

### Step 3: If Drop Doesn't Work Either

We need to investigate further:
1. Check if `ü™ü Window drop event caught` appears (from App.tsx handler)
2. Try dragging to different areas of window
3. Try different file sources (Desktop vs Finder)
4. Use Browse Files as workaround

---

## Why This Happened

Tauri's native file-drop on macOS is **flaky**. From Tauri discussions:

- macOS has strict security policies around drag-drop
- WebView might need explicit permissions
- Some macOS versions don't emit events reliably
- HTML5 fallback is the recommended approach

**This is why we implemented HTML5 handlers as backup!**

---

## Immediate Test

Please try this right now:

1. **Drag a video file over ClipForge window**
2. **Release/drop it (don't just hover)**
3. **Share what console logs appear**

Expected logs (HTML5 mode):
```
üéØ DRAG ENTER EVENT FIRED
üîÑ DRAG OVER EVENT FIRED
üì¶ DROP EVENT FIRED
Processing file: video.mp4
‚úì Added clip
```

If you see these, everything is working! The lack of Tauri hover events is not critical - HTML5 is handling it.

---

## Summary

**Status:** Tauri native drag-events not firing (macOS limitation)
**Solution:** HTML5 drag-drop should work as fallback
**Test:** Actually drop the file (not just hover)
**Fallback:** Use "Browse Files" button

The system is designed with multiple layers:
1. Tauri native (ideal, but not firing)
2. HTML5 drag-drop (should work)
3. File picker button (definitely works)

At least one of these will work! Let's test #2 and #3.
