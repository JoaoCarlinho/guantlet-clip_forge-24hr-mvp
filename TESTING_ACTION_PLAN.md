# TESTING ACTION PLAN - ClipForge Drag-and-Drop & Video Playback

## ✅ GOOD NEWS: All Fixes Are Applied Successfully!

### Evidence from Latest Logs:

```
[Log] 🔍 FileDropZone mounted, checking environment...
[Log] 🎯 Setting up window-level drag handlers
[Log] ✅ Window-level drag handlers registered
[Log] ✅ Tauri API loaded - setting up native file drop
[Log] 🔍 Running in: TAURI MODE (V2)
[Log] ✅ Tauri file-drop listener registered
[Log] ✅ Tauri file-drop-hover listener registered
[Log] ✅ Tauri file-drop-cancelled listener registered
```

**🎉 All event listeners are properly registered!**
**🎉 No more "invalid args" errors!**
**🎉 Tauri V2 mode correctly detected!**

## 🧪 NEXT STEP: Manual Testing Required

The logs show the app is ready, but **no drag-and-drop events have been triggered yet**. This means:
- ✅ The fixes are applied correctly
- ✅ Event listeners are registered
- ⏳ **BUT: No one has actually tested dragging a file yet!**

---

## 📋 Step-by-Step Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Verify Drag-and-Drop Works

1. **Make sure the app is running:**
   ```bash
   yarn tauri dev
   ```
   (The app is currently running according to process list)

2. **Open the ClipForge window** (should already be open)

3. **Find a video file:**
   - Use an MP4 or MOV file
   - Keep it small for testing (under 100MB recommended)

4. **Drag the video file over the ClipForge window:**
   - You should see the drag overlay appear
   - **Expected console logs:**
     ```
     🟢 Tauri file-drop-hover event
     ```

5. **Drop the file:**
   - Release the mouse button to drop
   - **Expected console logs:**
     ```
     🟢 Tauri file-drop event: ["/path/to/your/video.mp4"]
     📁 Received 1 file path(s) from Tauri: ["/path/to/your/video.mp4"]
     Processing file path: /path/to/your/video.mp4
     ✓ Added clip: your-video.mp4 (XXX.XXs)
     🎬 VideoPlayer render: {clipsCount: 1, hasCurrentClip: true, ...}
     📹 Setting up video for clip: your-video.mp4
     ✅ Video load started for: your-video.mp4
     ✅ Video metadata loaded: {duration: XXX, ...}
     ✅ Video data loaded successfully for: your-video.mp4
     ✅ Video can play: your-video.mp4
     ```

---

### Test 2: Verify Video Playback

1. **After dropping the video (from Test 1):**
   - The video should appear in the player
   - Video controls should be visible

2. **Click the play button:**
   - Video should play
   - No errors in console

3. **Test controls:**
   - Pause: Should pause the video
   - Seek: Drag the progress bar, video should seek
   - Volume: Should adjust volume

4. **Check console for any errors:**
   - If you see `❌ Video element error`, share the error details

---

### Test 3: Verify Multi-File Support

1. **With a video already loaded:**
   - Drag another video file over the window
   - **This tests that FileDropZone stays mounted!**

2. **Expected behavior:**
   - Drag overlay should still appear
   - Second video should be added to timeline
   - Both videos should appear in the timeline section

3. **Expected console logs:**
   ```
   🟢 Tauri file-drop-hover event
   🟢 Tauri file-drop event: ["/path/to/second-video.mp4"]
   📁 Received 1 file path(s) from Tauri
   ✓ Added clip: second-video.mp4 (XXX.XXs)
   ```

---

### Test 4: Test Browse Files Button (Alternative to Drag-Drop)

1. **Click the "Browse Files" button**

2. **Select a video file from the file picker**

3. **Expected console logs:**
   ```
   Processing file: your-video.mp4, type: video/mp4, size: XX.XX MB
   ✓ Added clip: your-video.mp4 (XXX.XXs)
   🎬 VideoPlayer render: {clipsCount: 1, ...}
   📹 Setting up video for clip: your-video.mp4
   ```

4. **Verify video loads and plays**

---

### ❌ Failure Scenarios & Solutions:

#### Scenario 1: No Drag Events Fire
**Symptoms:**
- Drag file over window
- No console logs appear at all
- No "🟢 Tauri file-drop-hover" message

**Possible Causes:**
- FileDropZone is not visible/rendered
- Tauri window doesn't have focus

**Solutions:**
1. Click on the ClipForge window to give it focus
2. Check if FileDropZone is visible (should see drop zone UI)
3. Try dragging from different source (Desktop vs Finder)

#### Scenario 2: Drag Events Fire But File Doesn't Process
**Symptoms:**
- See "🟢 Tauri file-drop event" in console
- But no "Processing file path" message
- No video appears

**Possible Causes:**
- File type not supported
- File path conversion issue

**Solutions:**
1. Check the file extension (must be .mp4 or .mov)
2. Look for error messages in console after drop event
3. Try a different video file

#### Scenario 3: Video Doesn't Play After Upload
**Symptoms:**
- File processes successfully
- See "✓ Added clip" message
- But video doesn't appear or is black/frozen

**Possible Causes:**
- Video codec not supported
- Blob URL or file path issue

**Solutions:**
1. Check console for `❌ Video error` messages
2. Look for error code (will be 1-4)
3. Try a different video file (standard H.264 MP4)

#### Scenario 4: Second File Can't Be Dropped
**Symptoms:**
- First file works fine
- But dragging second file doesn't show overlay
- FileDropZone might have unmounted

**Possible Causes:**
- Our fix didn't apply correctly
- Component re-render issue

**Solutions:**
1. Check console for "🧹 Cleaning up Tauri listeners" (shouldn't happen)
2. Refresh the app and try again
3. Check if FileDropZone is still in the DOM

## 📊 Current Status Based on Logs

### What We Know:
✅ **App is running** (process 96085, 96084)
✅ **Tauri mode detected** ("Running in: TAURI MODE (V2)")
✅ **All event listeners registered successfully**
✅ **No error messages**
✅ **FileDropZone is mounted**
✅ **Window-level drag handlers registered**

### What We DON'T Know Yet:
⏳ **Does drag-drop actually trigger events?** (No one has tested yet)
⏳ **Does video playback work?** (No video has been uploaded yet)
⏳ **Does multi-file work?** (Haven't tested second file)

---

## 🎯 Recommended Test Sequence

### Quick Test (5 minutes):
1. Drag one video file and drop it
2. Verify it plays
3. Done! ✅

### Thorough Test (15 minutes):
1. Test drag-and-drop with one file
2. Verify video playback (play, pause, seek)
3. Test Browse Files button
4. Test dragging second file while first is playing
5. Test with different video formats (MP4, MOV)
6. Test error handling (drag non-video file)

## 📝 How to Report Results

### If Everything Works:
```
✅ Drag-and-drop: WORKING
✅ Video playback: WORKING
✅ Multi-file: WORKING

Console showed:
- All "✅" success messages
- No "❌" errors
- Video loaded and played successfully
```

### If Something Fails:
```
❌ Issue: [Describe what happened]

Console logs:
[Paste relevant console logs, especially any ❌ errors]

Steps to reproduce:
1. [What you did]
2. [What you expected]
3. [What actually happened]
```

---

## 🚀 Expected Outcome

Based on the successful initialization logs, **both features should work perfectly**:

1. **Drag-and-Drop:** ✅ Should work in Tauri mode
2. **Video Playback:** ✅ Should work after upload
3. **Multi-File:** ✅ Should allow additional files
4. **Error Handling:** ✅ Should show clear error messages if issues occur

**The fixes are in place. Now we need real-world testing to confirm!**

---

## 🔄 If Issues Persist

If you test and still encounter issues:

1. **Capture the console output:**
   - Copy all logs from the browser console
   - Look for any `❌` error messages

2. **Update the log file:**
   ```bash
   # The console output will automatically update inspect_info.md
   # Just share the new contents
   ```

3. **Describe what happened:**
   - What did you drag?
   - What did you see (or not see)?
   - Any error messages?

4. **I can then:**
   - Analyze the new logs
   - Identify any remaining issues
   - Provide additional fixes

---

## Summary

**Current Status:** ✅ **READY FOR TESTING**

**All fixes applied:**
- ✅ Tauri V2 event names corrected
- ✅ FileDropZone always mounted
- ✅ Window-level drag handlers added

**Next step:** **TEST IT!** 🧪

Drag a video file and see what happens. The logs will tell us exactly what's working and what needs additional fixes (if anything).
