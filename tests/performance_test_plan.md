# Performance Testing Plan - ClipForge MVP

## Test Objective
Validate that ClipForge maintains smooth UI responsiveness and stable memory usage when handling 10+ video clips over a 15-minute session.

## Performance Criteria

### 1. Multi-Clip Performance (10+ Clips)
**Target Metrics:**
- Timeline rendering: < 100ms for 10 clips
- Clip selection: < 50ms response time
- Trim marker dragging: 60 fps (16.67ms per frame)
- No visible lag in UI interactions

**Test Procedure:**
1. Import 10 video clips (mix of MP4 and MOV files)
2. Add all clips to timeline
3. Select each clip and verify selection response time
4. Apply trim points to 5 random clips
5. Drag trim markers and verify smooth animation
6. Play/pause clips and verify responsive controls

### 2. Memory Stability (15-Minute Session)
**Target Metrics:**
- Initial memory: < 200 MB
- Memory after 15 min: < 400 MB
- No memory leaks (steady state after initial loading)
- Blob URLs properly cleaned up

**Test Procedure:**
1. Open ClipForge and note initial memory (Chrome DevTools)
2. Import 10 clips
3. Perform 20 operations:
   - Add/remove clips
   - Modify trim points
   - Export 3 videos
   - Download exported videos
   - Reset export state
4. Monitor memory usage every 3 minutes
5. Check for orphaned blob URLs in DevTools
6. Verify video elements are cleaned up on unmount

### 3. Export Performance
**Target Metrics:**
- Single clip export: < 30 seconds for 1-minute video
- Progress updates: Every 5% increment
- Memory cleanup: Blob URLs revoked after download
- No browser freeze during export

**Test Procedure:**
1. Export a 1-minute clip
2. Verify progress bar updates smoothly
3. Check export log for detailed messages
4. Download exported video
5. Verify blob URL cleanup in DevTools
6. Repeat 3 times to check for memory buildup

### 4. UI Responsiveness
**Target Metrics:**
- React component render: < 16ms (60 fps)
- Kea state updates: < 10ms
- Timeline scroll: Smooth at 60 fps
- Video playback: Synchronized with controls

**Test Procedure:**
1. Open React DevTools Profiler
2. Record interaction session with 10 clips
3. Analyze component render times
4. Verify no components blocking main thread
5. Check for unnecessary re-renders

## Known Optimizations Implemented

### Phase 6 Optimizations:
1. **Kea State Management:**
   - No large binary data in reducers
   - Blob URLs (strings) used instead of raw video data
   - Efficient selector memoization

2. **Memory Leak Prevention:**
   - VideoPlayer cleanup on unmount (pause, clear src, load)
   - ExportPanel cleanup on unmount
   - Blob URL revocation in projectLogic listeners
   - FileDropZone temporary URL cleanup

3. **Redis Caching (Placeholder):**
   - cache.rs module created for future thumbnail caching
   - Prevents storing large data in Kea state
   - 24-hour expiry for cached thumbnails

4. **Performance Best Practices:**
   - React key prop for efficient list rendering
   - CSS Grid for efficient layout
   - Minimal re-renders with Kea selectors
   - Video element reuse with key prop

## Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Import 10+ clips without UI lag
- [ ] Timeline remains responsive with 15+ clips
- [ ] Trim markers drag smoothly at 60 fps
- [ ] Export completes without freezing browser
- [ ] Memory usage stable over 15 minutes
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] Video playback synchronized with controls
- [ ] Blob URLs cleaned up after export/download

## Automated Testing (Future)

For post-MVP iterations, consider:
- Playwright/Cypress for E2E performance testing
- Memory profiling automation with Puppeteer
- Lighthouse performance audits
- React Profiler API integration
- Continuous performance regression testing

## Notes

This performance test plan ensures ClipForge MVP meets the stability and responsiveness requirements outlined in the PRD. All optimizations from Phase 6 should be verified against these criteria before deployment.
